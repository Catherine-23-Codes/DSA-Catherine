Recursion deals with:
    1.Iteration
    2.Function
    
Recursion is a method of solving compuutational problem where the
solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
                        OR

Recursion- way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself

Steps:
1.define BASE CASE
2.execute the desired function/work
3.call back the function

Recursion key characteristics:
1. performing same operation multiple times with different inputs
2.in every step we try smaller ip to make problem smaller
3.BASE CASE is needed to stop the recursion otherwise infinte loop occurs.




LOGIC Recursion
1.A method calls itself
2.exit from infinte loop
